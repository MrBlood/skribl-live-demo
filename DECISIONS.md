# Decisions that are yours to confirm

## 1. New posts default to `unlisted`

`skribl/routes.py` — `payload.get("visibility", "unlisted")`, and the v132
migration backfills every existing row as `unlisted`.

**Why.** A v131 Skribl was already effectively unlisted: it had a share URL,
anyone with the link could watch, and it appeared in no timeline because no
timeline existed. Defaulting to `public` would have retroactively published every
Skribl anyone ever made into a brand-new feed — including drafts, tests, and
things shared with exactly one person.

**What it costs.** Your platform must opt posts IN. If the post UI does not send
`"visibility": "public"`, the Skribl is created, gets a working share link, and
appears in no feed. Nothing errors, so it is easy to miss.

**Recommendation.** Have your platform's post UI send `"visibility": "public"`
explicitly, rather than changing the default here. That keeps the safe default
for the standalone app and for any other API client, and makes "this is feed
content" a statement by the surface that actually knows.

**Leave the migration's backfill alone** either way. That concerns posts that
already exist, made under different expectations, and republishing them is not
something you can undo once people have seen it.

## 2. CSRF is off by default

`SKRIBL_CSRF_PROTECT=1` enables it. Off is correct standalone — the API is
unauthenticated, so there is no session to protect and enabling it only breaks
existing clients. Turning it on by default broke 24 assertions across other
suites, every one a token-less POST correctly getting a 403.

**A host that authenticates POST /api/skribls with a cookie MUST switch it on.**
Without it, any page on the internet can post as the logged-in user.

## 3. Media storage defaults to `inline`

`SKRIBL_MEDIA_BACKEND=local` externalises blobs. The default is still v131
behaviour, deliberately: a storage change to a system holding real posts should
be opted into, not inherited by upgrading.

## 4. No foreign key from `skribl_posts.user_id` to a host user table

`user_id` is an indexed integer with no FK. This keeps Skribl droppable and lets
it run standalone. The trade is no referential integrity and no cascade delete —
deleting a user leaves their Skribls addressed to a missing id. If your platform
wants cascade behaviour, add the constraint in your own migration rather than
here, so Skribl stays independent.

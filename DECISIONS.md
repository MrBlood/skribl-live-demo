# Decisions that are yours to confirm

## 1. New posts default to `unlisted`

`skribl/routes.py` — `payload.get("visibility", "unlisted")`, and the v132
migration backfills every existing row as `unlisted`.

**Why.** A v131 Skribl was already effectively unlisted: it had a share URL,
anyone with the link could watch, and it appeared in no timeline because no
timeline existed. Defaulting to `public` would have retroactively published every
Skribl anyone ever made into a brand-new feed — including drafts, tests, and
things shared with exactly one person.

**What it costs.** Your platform must opt posts IN. If the post UI does not send
`"visibility": "public"`, the Skribl is created, gets a working share link, and
appears in no feed. Nothing errors, so it is easy to miss.

**Recommendation.** Have your platform's post UI send `"visibility": "public"`
explicitly, rather than changing the default here. That keeps the safe default
for the standalone app and for any other API client, and makes "this is feed
content" a statement by the surface that actually knows.

**Leave the migration's backfill alone** either way. That concerns posts that
already exist, made under different expectations, and republishing them is not
something you can undo once people have seen it.

## 2. CSRF is off by default

`SKRIBL_CSRF_PROTECT=1` enables it. Off is correct standalone — the API is
unauthenticated, so there is no session to protect and enabling it only breaks
existing clients. Turning it on by default broke 24 assertions across other
suites, every one a token-less POST correctly getting a 403.

**A host that authenticates POST /api/skribls with a cookie MUST switch it on.**
Without it, any page on the internet can post as the logged-in user.

## 3. Media storage defaults to `inline`

`SKRIBL_MEDIA_BACKEND=local` externalises blobs. The default is still v131
behaviour, deliberately: a storage change to a system holding real posts should
be opted into, not inherited by upgrading.

## 4. No foreign key from `skribl_posts.user_id` to a host user table

`user_id` is an indexed integer with no FK. This keeps Skribl droppable and lets
it run standalone. The trade is no referential integrity and no cascade delete —
deleting a user leaves their Skribls addressed to a missing id. If your platform
wants cascade behaviour, add the constraint in your own migration rather than
here, so Skribl stays independent.

## 5. Segmented controls are squared (`--r-seg`), labelled actions stay pills

**This reverses a v207-era rule and is the owner's call, made deliberately.**
The old rule read "pill segment = one-of-N with sliding highlight" and carried
an explicit "do NOT unify to one shape". That rule is now narrower: shape still
carries meaning, but corner radius is no longer the thing carrying it.

**The rule now.**

> **Round = an action you press. Squared = a group you choose within.**
> **Radius follows the container, not the semantics** — a cell inside a
> segmented group takes the container's derived inner radius, whatever the cell
> happens to do.

**Why it changed.** A 999px radius is a promise a control cannot keep once it
gets small. Measured on Flip at phone width: the tool group's active cell was a
37x24 box at radius 999px — i.e. a **circle** — sitting 6px from rounded-square
tiles carrying a 12px corner. Radius had stopped encoding "this is a one-of-N
group" and had started reading as an inconsistency. `--r-seg: 12px` is the tile
radius (`.t-btn` / `.tool-open`), so a segmented group now shares its
neighbours' corner and is told apart by the thing that actually distinguishes
it: a shared container with a sliding highlight. That signal survives at 24px.

**What is squared** (`--r-seg`, inner radii derived as `calc(var(--r-seg) - N)`
where N is the container's padding — never typed):

| family | where |
| --- | --- |
| `.tool-group` | Pad + Flip tool rows |
| `.seg` | onion depth/tint, fps, mirror, move scope, loop focus, zoom — 7 in Flip, 6 in Pad, 2 shared |
| `.smooth-seg` | smoothing off/low/high |
| `.photo-fit-group` | Fill / Fit / Stretch |
| `.edge-controls` | loop start/end/step nudge groups |
| `.nudge-btn` | the cells inside `.edge-controls` |

**What stays round, and why each is not an oversight:**

* **Labelled actions** — Post, Record, `loop-btn` (Match Drawing Time / Test
  Seam / Preview Loop), `dropzone-remove`. These are 4:1 to 8:1 boxes where a
  round end reads as deliberate rather than as a circle. Post especially: the
  design direction wants it to be the one loud thing on the surface.
* **`layer-toggle`** — an on/off switch. Round toggle = on/off is unchanged.
* **`color-ring`** — a colour swatch. A squared colour dot reads as a chip.
* **Surfaces** — `.toolbar` (16px), `.menu-sheet` (16px), `.flip-menu` (14px),
  `.pagebar` (0). You do not choose *within* a surface, so they keep their own
  radii; squaring a 530px-tall menu sheet to 12px makes it look like a button.

**How to reverse it.** Set `--r-seg: 999px` in `:root` (styles.css) and every
pill returns in one line. Nothing else needs touching, and the harness pin does
not need editing either — `verify_ux` reads the resolved token rather than a
literal, precisely so this decision stays the owner's to make.

**One operational note.** Editing `styles.css` requires re-emitting the derived
player stylesheet:

    python3 harness/tools/cssgraph.py --emit harness/tools/css_live.json skribl/static/player.css

`verify_cssplit.py` fails if you forget. It caught exactly that during this work.
